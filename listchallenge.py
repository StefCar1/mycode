heroes= ["0-Spiderman", "1-Batman", "2-Black Panther", "3-Wonder Woman", "4-Storm"]

# PART 1
# Print out your favorite character from this list! The output would look something like:
print(heroes)
num = int(input("Who is your favorite super hero? Type the number associated with the hero to select them. "))
favorite = heroes[num]

#print(favorite)
# My favorite character is Black Panther!
print(f"You have selected {favorite} as your favorite super hero!")

# PART 2
# Ask the user to pick a number between 1 and 100.
num1 = int(input("Choose a number between 1 and 100")
# Convert the input into an integer.


nums= [1, -5, 56, 987, 0]

# PART 3
# check out https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html or go to Google
# use a built-in function to find which integer in nums is the biggest.
# then, print out that number!
